One of the most intersting projects of my Maths module creating a Bézier suface from couple points in a 3 dimentioned map. Didnt manage to implement the complicated alagorythm found on wikipedia here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bézier_surface. If you're lazy to read all that the main idea is to find points that arnt given as data by creating an average.
